          I am a passionate software engineer with a knack for crafting elegant
          solutions to complex problems. With two years of experience in the
          industry, I have honed my skills in Front-End and Back-End
          technologies. I have started my journey as Back-End Software Engineer
          ( Spring Boot), I am very strong at problem solving and crictical
          thinking to solve the problems. Then, I stepped into the Front-End
          world with self-learning, I gained the basic kowledge and then crafted
          a website from scratched to live product. <br /> As a lifelong
          learner, I am constantly seeking out opportunities to expand my
          knowledge and stay abreast of the latest technologies and trends in
          the field. I believe that continuous learning is essential for
          personal and professional growth.
